# DefaultDetector

This is a school project I extended into a full web app. Using the website you can run my ML model on a random sample of clients. The model will predict whether it thinks the client will default or not and the front end will give some analysis on the performance of the model.

The backend is running a flask server and the frontend is a static build I make with SvelteKit.
